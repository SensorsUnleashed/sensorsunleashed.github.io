                  The Sensors Unleashed project was started in the spring of 2016.
                  The goal of the project, is to create a simple, yet powerfull
                  sensor network, where one device can be paired with one or more
                  devices. There is no central control unit - a device knows
                  only about its connection, nothing else.
                </p>

                  This project is started because I found that there
                  was a lag of a true open alternative to commercial products.
                  Commercial products has a tendency to focus more inwards, than
                  on its customers - they often use closed source software,
                  non documented, encrypted communication to the outside world,
                  and personal privacy is translated to big data and commercial
                  interests. I understand the strategy, but I don't agree on it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b><i><u>This project will focus on the exact opposite.</u></i></b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I hope that this project will evolve to a community driven
                  project - meaning, designers, coders, inventors, entreprenours
                  etc are more than welcome to join. The more the marrier.
