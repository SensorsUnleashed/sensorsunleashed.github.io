The Sensors Unleashed project is started by me, Ole Nissen. It was started because I found that there was a lag a true open alternative to commercial products. Commercial products has a tendency to focus more inwards, than on its customers - leaving us without intercompability between alike products. Besides - I always wonder what will happen to the products I bought, if the company making them i shut down.... Letting it all be open source, anyone could continue the productline, should I choose to stop.

This should be a community driven project - meaning, designers, coders, inventors, entreprenours etc are more than welcome to join. The more the marrier.

The projet is kindly hosted by [github](https://github.com/SensorsUnleashed)
