All software is available for download on Github. Feel free to use it, and if
you like it, please consider supporting us.

What you gain from the decision of being open sourced:

* Your collection of devices will still work, even if the company behind closes.
* Privacy. Noone knows what is flowing in and out your local network if communication
is encrypted, and only they have the key.
* Security. Open source projects tend to fix bugs and patch vulnerabilities quicker - take linux as an example
