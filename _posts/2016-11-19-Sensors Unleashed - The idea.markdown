I live in an old house with no possibilty to add any advanced bells or wistles. If I want to link one light with another, I'm forced to route physical wires from one light to another. Most often with the wires visible. What I needed was a way to use my old  link two wireless devices, and thats why I came up with this project.

A devices will publish its capabilities, and anyone can link up with it. E.g. a button will publish it self as a toggle button. It will send out 1 for on and 0 for off. Any other devices, can then be paired with the device and act on its on or off events.

Button ----> Relay (Light)

These simple features can be expanded to be extremely advanced. For istance, If I want to teach my 5 year old daugter about what money is and can do, I could let her pocket money be dependent of the amount of time she spend consuming power in front of her tv. I could link a system like

Button ----> Timer
Button ----> Relay (TV Plug)

The Button will be linked to both a plug and a relay. When it is turned on, the timer will start counting, and off, the timer will stop again. Every month I will read the timer, and ajust her pocket money accordingly.

I could also do this:

Button ----> Timer ----> Relay

I could adjust the timer to only relay the button press event between 5pm to 7pm.

You get the point. Anything is just a plain link, and the only limitation is the amount of different devices available.

I want the system to follow open standards, it has to be open source, and it has to be community driven!
