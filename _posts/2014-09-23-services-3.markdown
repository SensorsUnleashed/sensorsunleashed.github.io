All the design files for all the devices are available from the [github](https://github.com/SensorsUnleashed) repository. This way, everyone can inspect, improve and comment on the design, and together we'll have the best devices available.
What good is design files, if it takes a 8000$ program to use them. Therefore hardware will be designed using [FreeCad](https://www.freecadweb.org/), [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) and [KiCAD](http://kicad-pcb.org/).

_If anyone needs a specific device we will be glad to help._
